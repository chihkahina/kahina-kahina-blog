# Objectif

the study of the distribution of planktonic classes in a marine space, we will perform a graphic analysis of the dataset that comes from the data.io zooplankton package, and intrepreter them.
# Importation

```{r importation}
data <- read("zooplankton", package = "data.io")
``` 
# Analyses graphiques

```{r }
  chart(data = zooplankton, ~ class %fill=% class) +
  geom_bar() +
ylab("Effictifs") +
  coord_flip()
```

Distribution of the 17 classes of planktonic organisms, the graph shows us that the Calanoid are the most abundant species in the study area, and the cnidarians and cirripeds the least observed.
